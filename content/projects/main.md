# Projects

Projects are the central action of Thaumazo, bringing together all the other elements. Thaumazo will provide several types of opportunities for people to come together and work for set periods on projects of their choosing. While Thaumazo will provide pre-structured project opportunities, an emphasis will be placed on self-organizing, emergent groups working together to assess problem spaces, ideate projects, and carry them out, documenting the process, results, learnings and resources involved. This documentation will serve as precedent for future projects, as research on how to better run emergent projects, to help those involved build their skills, momentum and profile in their work, and help Thaumazo fine-tune its overall process.

These projects will be added to the resources, and help grow its community and partnerships.
