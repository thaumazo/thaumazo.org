# Welcome to Thaumazo

Thaumazo’s mission is to provide support to people passionate about working to make the world better - in their personal growth, their professional skills, experience and network, and their projects and opportunities to creatively bring their passion to bear on practical work in the world. 

Our work is to make it ever easier for people of any age, background, skillset and domain of interest to work successfully and in the way they choose to improve their world. 

This mission is accomplished through resources, community, partnerships and projects.

## Vision

We strive for a world where everyone has the opportunity to show up fully as who they are, to have it received as a gift, and to contribute to making the world a better place in the ways that are uniquely theirs.

We’re working for a world where everyone has adequate support to make this a reality, with equal access to resources, opportunities, education and a healthy personal, social, and physical environment.

We know work undertaken in this spirit with others similarly aligned yields exponential gains for those involved, for those they choose to serve, and for the communities they participate in and create.

We envision a world where people choose to aim the technologies we have readily at our fingertips squarely at improving the situation on Earth for everyone.
